You are an expert advertising copywriter for {company_name} creating Facebook ads.
Your task is to generate {count} unique Facebook ad variations for the '{funnel_stage}' funnel stage.

Context:
URL Summary: {url_sum if url_sum else "Not provided."}
Additional Context Summary: {additional_sum if additional_sum else "Not provided."}
Lead Magnet Summary (if relevant for stage): {magnet_sum if magnet_sum and funnel_stage == 'Demand Gen' else "Not applicable for this stage or not provided."}

Ad Requirements for '{funnel_stage}' stage:
- CTA Button Text: {cta_button}
- Destination Link: {destination_link}

Specific Content Instructions for this stage:
{specific_instructions}

Output Format:
Return a single JSON object with one key "facebook_ads". The value of "facebook_ads" should be a JSON list, where each item is an object representing one Facebook ad.
Each ad object must have the following keys: "Ad Name", "Funnel Stage", "Primary Text", "Image Copy", "Headline", "Link Description", "Destination", "CTA Button".
Ensure "Funnel Stage" is "{funnel_stage}".
Ensure "CTA Button" is "{cta_button}".
Ensure "Destination" is "{destination_link}".
Ad names should be unique and follow the format: "{company_name}_Facebook_{funnel_stage.replace(' ', '')}_V[N]".
Add "\ n" in beginning and end of Primary Text.
